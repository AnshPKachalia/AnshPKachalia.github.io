                The website layout itself is abstract and alludes to the ongoing Covid-19 situation. It is a metaphor such that the video titled" 2020 Quarantine|What People Do" is bound between its 4 borders which are symbolic of us being bound by our four walls during lockdown. Further, it is surrounded by some of the biggest happenings of the globe during this quarantine period and this shows that the World still moved on.To give more meaning to this metaphor and to add to the story I was trying to convey, the colour scheme I used was black and white to denote feelings of remorse, loss and fear of the unknown.

            <p>To convey the story behind this video was the main goal of this webpage and the sense of vagueness that a first time viewer is hit by is also intentional as it alludes to lack of awareness and disconnectedness we all felt during this pandemic. I wanted it to highlight the crude reality of the World that went beyond the pandemic and didn't even come to a halt when we were all literally bound in our homes.</p></div>
