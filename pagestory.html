                The website layout itself is abstract and alludes to the ongoing Covid-19 situation. It is a metaphor such that the video titled" 2020 Quarantine|What People Do" is bound between its 4 borders which are symbolic of us being bound by our four walls during lockdown. Further, it is surrounded by some of the biggest happenings of the globe during this quarantine period and this shows that the World still moved on.

            <p>To convey the story behind this video was the main goal of this webpage and the sense of vagueness that a first time viewer is hit by is also intentional as it alludes to lack of awareness and disconnectedness we all felt during this pandemic.</p></div>
